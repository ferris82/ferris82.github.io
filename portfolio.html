				    <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my Portfolio! My name is Ferry Sugiarto and I’m a professional game programmer from Surabaya.</p> 
            <p>Ever since my childhood, I’ve been obsessed with video games. Growing up in the 90s, I quickly fell in love with games. Even back then, I already knew that my dream was to become a game developer one day.</p> 
            <p>I have a lot of experience making flash games (15+ projects). I'm working at Artlogic Games previously as a main programmer. (2008 - 2013)</p> 
            <p>After the flash game is getting shutdown, I focused on unity, and have successfully made 2 games from that engine on WebGL and Android platforms.</p> 
            <p>In all those years, I’ve never lost my passion for playing and making games, and I keep doing so, even in private.</p> 
            <p></p>
